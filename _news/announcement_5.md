Our [paper](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2402387121) publishes at Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). We discuss how big data driven machine learning models can ignore important variables and their effects. We propose a causal framework to improve interpretability and instruct most efficient intervention.
