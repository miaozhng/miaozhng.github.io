I am a Ph.D. student at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Rumi Chunara](https://rumichunara.github.io/). I am a member of [ChunaraLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/chunaralab/) and [ViDA](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/). 

I have a broad interests in the intersection of deep learning for computer vision and algorithmic fairness. 
My current research aims to unpack bias source for real-world vision datasets and provide fairness guidance. With that goal, I have explored topics of self-supervised learning, transfer learning, and causal inference.

Previously, I obtained my Masters degree in [CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/) from Stanford University, where I performed research in federated learning for medical image analysis at [QIAI](https://rubinlab.stanford.edu/) advised by [Prof. Daniel Rubin](https://profiles.stanford.edu/daniel-rubin). I finished my undegrad in Electrical Engineering at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, when I started the machine learning journey advised by [Prof. Dong Wang](http://wangd.cslt.org/) in Tsinghua University.
