I am a fourth year Ph.D. candidate at [New York University](https://www.nyu.edu/), advised by [Prof. Rumi Chunara](https://rumichunara.github.io/). I am a member of [ChunaraLab](https://wp.nyu.edu/chunaralab/) and [ViDA](https://vida.engineering.nyu.edu/). Currently, I mainly work on reliable AI and generalizability for my Ph.D. degree. I received my Master degree from Stanford University in in [CCRMA](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/), when I performed research in federated learning for medical image analysis at [QIAI](https://rubinlab.stanford.edu/) advised by [Prof. Daniel Rubin](https://profiles.stanford.edu/daniel-rubin). In my undergrad, I worked with [Prof. Dong Wang](http://wangd.cslt.org/) at Tsinghua University on speech processing and recognition. 

I have broad interests in:

**Trustworthy AI:** Algorithmic fairness, robustness, and generalization to out-of-domain.
**Computer vision and multimodal** 
**Real-world health and environmental application**
